                                    Video summarization is the process of providing a short trailer so that a viewer can get the 
                                    gist without investing much time in watching the entire video. This is done by selecting the 
                                    frames which collectively represent the video in a concise way. This service can be integrated
                                    with online video browsing platforms so that it can be helpful for a viewer to select a video. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are several supervised approaches available for video summarization. They use human
                                    generated summaries as labels. Also, reinforcement learning has been used by Song et al. 2016
                                    to make use of keyframe-labels and category information of training videos to train their agent.
                                    However human labels are subjected to opinions therefore these approaches may not guarantee an
                                    unbiased summary.

                                    Our solution is based on Zhou, K., & Qiao, Y. (2018) where a Deep Summmarization Network is used 
                                    to summarize unlabelled videos. This appproach is completely unsupervised. On top of that we used 
                                    augmentations and alternate reinforcement learning algorithm to evaluate any performance improvement.

                                    The solution uses a Deep Summarization Network that consists of an Encoder and a Decoder to
                                    select a frame for summarization based on predicted probabilities. And there is a reward 
                                    function that evaluates the generated summary by determining how diverse the selected frames
                                    are and how much they represent the entire video.   
                                </p>
                                <h3>Encoder</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The encoder is a pretrained CNN used to extract features from the video frames. In this 
                                    case we used ResNet50/ResNet101. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Decoder</h3> 
                                <p>
                                    The decoder is a bidirectional RNN (we used LSTM) which accepts the extracted features and
                                    predicts the probability distribution for a frame to be selected. This component is trainable.
                                </p>  
                                <h3>Reward Function</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The reward funtion calculates the diversity among the video frames and how representative are
                                    the selected frames of the entire video. The diversity part aims for dissimilarities of the
                                    frames in feature space although allowing similar features among frames which are temporaly
                                    distant and the representative part encourages selection of frames that are closest to the 
                                    centroids of clusters of feature space. 
                                </p> 
                                <p>
                                    This reward is used for training the decoder using REINFORCE/PPO with the aim of maximizing
                                    the rewards.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Augmentation</h3>
                                <p>
                                    We use the following augmentation techniques on the videos:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>GaussianBlur</li>
                                    <li>Cutout</li>
                                    <li>Cutout Color</li>
                                    <li>Rotate</li>
                                    <li>Flip</li>
                                    <li>Center Crop</li>
                                    <li>Grayscale</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>
                                    We ensure that these augmentations are applied uniformly along the temporal dimension, i.e. in 
                                    the Cutout augmentation, we ensure that the same patch is blacked out in all frames of the video to 
                                    ensure that the temporal information is not affected.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Dataset </h3>
                                <p>
                                    We train our model architectures on the TVSum dataset using the cross-validation method. Following Zhou et 
                                    al., we perform 5 fold cross-validation and report our average out-of-fold F1 score. We also evaluate 
                                    our model the SumMe dataset to test the generalization of our models. Note that SumMe is an 
                                    out-of-distribution data and our model is not trained on this dataset.

                                    We train our models on 5 different seeds and report mean and standard deviation of the F1 score.
                                    We were able to observe that augmentations improve the F1 score of our model on the TVSum and SumMe
                                    dataset. We also observed that the PPO algorithm performs better than REINFORCE algorithm. The smaller
                                    backbone, which is the Resnet50 performs better than the larger backbone, i.e.  Resnet101. The result 
                                    of our model the SumMe dataset also improves with augmentations. Note that this score is not comparable 
                                    to models which are trained on this dataset.
